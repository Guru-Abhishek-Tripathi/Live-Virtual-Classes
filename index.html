                <center><h2>What is Virtual learning?</h2></center> 
                 <center><p align="justify">Virtual learning is usually associated with online courses or online environments, but it has much broader dimensions. In this article we will discuss its definition, characteristics, and benefits. We have also made for you a list of the most common forms of virtual learning, which describe the different aspects of learning and teaching process. Virtual learning is a learning experience that is enhanced through utilizing computers and/or the internet both outside and inside the facilities of the educational organization. The instruction most commonly takes place in an online environment.</p>
                 <h2>Effect of virtual learning</h2>              
                 <p align="justify">The teaching activities are carried out online whereby the teacher and learners are physically separated (in terms of place, time, or both). Behaviorism examines how students behave while learning. It focuses on how learners respond to certain stimuli. When the teacher repeats the stimuli, they can observe, control, and modify the learner's individual behavior. Learners do what they are instructed to do and are only prepared to reproduce basic facts and automatically perform tasks. Behaviorism does not examine the mind or cognitive processes.In virtual learning behaviorism can be applied through step-by-step video tutorials, game-based activities, regular and constructive feedback, quizzes, gamification, etc.</p> </center>
